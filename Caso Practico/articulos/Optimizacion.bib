@book{Messac2015,
abstract = {Optimization in Practice with MATLAB{\textregistered} provides a unique approach to optimization education. It is accessible to both junior and senior undergraduate and graduate students, as well as industry practitioners. It provides a strongly practical perspective that allows the student to be ready to use optimization in the workplace. It covers traditional materials, as well as important topics previously unavailable in optimization books (e.g., Numerical Essentials - for successful optimization). Written with both the reader and the instructor in mind, Optimization in Practice with MATLAB{\textregistered} provides practical applications of real-world problems using MATLAB{\textregistered}, with a suite of practical examples and exercises that help the students link the theoretical, the analytical, and the computational in each chapter. Additionally, supporting MATLAB{\textregistered} m-files are available for download via www.cambridge.org.messac. Lastly, adopting instructors will receive a comprehensive solution manual with solution codes along with lectures in PowerPoint with animations for each chapter, and the text's unique flexibility enables instructors to structure one- or two-semester courses.},

@book{Ravindran2006,
abstract = {Market{\_}Desc: {\textperiodcentered} Senior and Graduate courses on Engineering Optimization as offered in Industrial, Mechanical and Chemical Engineering departments, Engineers in practice in virtually all engineering fields.Special Features: Engineering Optimization, Second Edition supplies the student and practicing engineer with the tools to understand and use optimization theory. {\textperiodcentered} Surveys all important optimization methods{\textperiodcentered} Covers both classical methods and new techniques that employ fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence{\textperiodcentered} Presentation-proofs of derivations are used only if they serve to explain key steps or propertiesAbout The Book: In the most general terms, optimization theory is a body of mathematical results and numerical methods for finding and identifying the best candidate from a collection of alternatives without having to explicitly enumerate and evaluate all possible alternatives. The process of optimization lies at the root of engineering, since the classical function of the engineer is to design new, better, more efficient and less expensive systems as well as to devise plans and procedures for the improved operation of existing systems. Most optimization routines are lengthy and therefore are efficiently applied through the use of the computer, but an understanding of the processes is needed to identify needs and interpret results. This book supplies the student and practicing engineer with the tools to understand and use optimization theory.},
