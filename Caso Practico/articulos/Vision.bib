abstract = {This paper shows for the first time that is possible to re- construct the position of rigid objects and to jointly recover affine camera calibration solely from a set of object detec- tions in a video sequence. In practice, this work can be con- sidered as the extension of Tomasi and Kanade factorization method using objects. Instead of using points to form a rank constrained measurement matrix, we can form a matrix with similar rank properties using 2D object detection proposals. In detail, we first fit an ellipse onto the image plane at each bounding box as given by the object detector. The collection of all the ellipses in the dual space is used to create a mea- surement matrix that gives a specific rank constraint. This matrix can be factorised and metrically upgraded in order to provide the affine camera matrices and the 3D position of the objects as an ellipsoid. Moreover, we recover the full 3D quadric thus giving additional information about object oc- cupancy and 3D pose. Finally, we also show that 2D points measurements can be seamlessly included in the framework to reduce the number of objects required. This last aspect unifies the classical point-based Tomasi and Kanade ap- proach with objects in a unique framework. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the feasibility of our ap- proach for the affine camera case. 1.},

@article{Farenzena2009,
abstract = {This papers introduces a novel hierarchical scheme for computing Structure and Motion. The images are organized into a tree with agglomerative clustering, using a measure of overlap as the distance. The reconstruction follows this tree from the leaves to the root. As a result, the problem is broken into smaller instances, which are then separately solved and combined. Compared to the standard sequential approach, this framework has a lower computational complexity, it is independent from the initial pair of views, and copes better with drift problems. A formal complexity analysis and some experimental results support these claims.},

@article{Szeliski2010,
abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},
