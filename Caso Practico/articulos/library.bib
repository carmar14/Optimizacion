abstract = {Smart grid initiatives will produce a grid that is increasingly dependent on its cyber infrastructure in order to support the numerous power applications necessary to provide improved grid monitoring and control capabilities. However, recent findings documented in government reports and other literature, indicate the growing threat of cyber-based attacks in numbers and sophistication targeting the nation's electric grid and other critical infrastructures. Specifically, this paper discusses cyber-physical security of Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) from a coordinated cyber attack perspective and introduces a game-theoretic approach to address the issue. Finally, the paper briefly describes how cyber-physical testbeds can be used to evaluate the security research and perform realistic attack-defense studies for smart grid type environments. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. A smart grid is a fully automated power electricity network, which operates, protects and controls all its physical environments of power electricity infrastructure being able to supply energy in an efficient and reliable way. As the importance of cyber-physical system (CPS) security is growing, various vulnerability analysis methodologies for general systems have been suggested, whereas there has been few practical research targeting the smart grid infrastructure. In this paper, we highlight the significance of security vulnerability analysis in the smart grid environment. Then we introduce various automated vulnerability analysis techniques from executable files. In our approach, we propose a novel binary-based vulnerability discovery method for AMI and EV charging system to automatically extract security-related features from the embedded software. Finally, we present the test result of vulnerability discovery applied for AMI and EV charging system in Korean smart grid environment.},

abstract = {Distributed tracking problem for complex dynamical networks with
Lipschitz-type nonlinear dynamics under the framework of cyber-physical
systems is investigated. Due to practical limitations in some
circumstances, the states of the agents are usually unavailable for
controllers, so distributed observers used to reconstruct the states of
nodes are needed, which will be first designed. Differing from other
studies of observer-based control problems for complex dynamical
networks and multi-agent systems, it considers here the scenario that
the communication channels for controllers and observers may be
subjected to frequently malicious attacks, which will destroy the
communication links and result in disconnected topologies of the
communication networks. It is assumed that the impacts of attacks on
different communication networks are different and independent. New
security control strategies are proposed and analyzed. An algorithm to
properly select the feedback gain matrices and coupling strengths is
presented. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient
conditions are derived to check whether final consensus tracking can be
achieved against such attacks. Finally, a simulation example comparing
the security control and uncontrolled scenarios is demonstrated to show
the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

@article{Krotofil2014,
abstract = {This paper presents a new vulnerability assessment model based on timing attacks. In particular, it examines the problem where an adversary has access to a certain sensor reading or a controller output signal in real time, but can only cause denial of service (DoS). Jamming the communications to a device can cause the system to work with stale data that, in turn, could interfere with the control algorithm to the extent of driving the system to an undesirable state. If the DoS attack is not timed properly, the use of stale data by the controller or actuator would have a limited impact on the process. However, if the attacker is able to launch the DoS attack at the correct time, the use of stale data can drive the system to an unsafe state. This paper uses the Tennessee Eastman challenge process to investigate the problem of an attacker who has to identify (in real time) the optimal moment to launch a DoS attack. The results suggest that, by attacking sensor and controller signals, the attacker can manipulate the process at will, but the success of the attack depends considerably on the specific stale values due to the dynamic nature of the process. The choice of time to begin an attack is forward-looking, requiring the attacker to consider each current opportunity against the possibility of a better opportunity in the future; this lends itself to the theory of optimal stopping problems. In particular, this paper studies the applicability of the Best Choice Problem (also known as the Secretary Problem), quickest change detection and statistical process outliers. The analysis can be used to identify specific sensor measurements that need to be protected and the time-to-response necessary to enable process operators and asset owners to define appropriate attack response strategies.},

Moreover, based on the information, we derive an attack taxonomy for embedded systems.

@article{Shoukry2016,
abstract = {We introduce a scalable observer architecture to estimate the states of a discrete-time linear-time-invariant (LTI) system whose sensors can be manipulated by an attacker. Given the maximum number of attacked sensors, we build on previous results on necessary and sufficient conditions for state estimation, and propose a novel multi-modal Luenberger (MML) observer based on efficient Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solving. We present two techniques to reduce the complexity of the estimation problem. As a first strategy, instead of a bank of distinct observers, we use a family of filters sharing a single dynamical equation for the states, but different output equations, to generate estimates corresponding to different subsets of sensors. Such an architecture can reduce the memory usage of the observer from an exponential to a linear function of the number of sensors. We then develop an efficient SMT-based decision procedure that is able to reason about the estimates of the MML observer to detect at runtime which sets of sensors are attack-free, and use them to obtain a correct state estimate. We provide proofs of convergence for our algorithm and report simulation results to compare its runtime performance with alternative techniques. Our algorithm scales well for large systems (including up to 5000 sensors) for which many previously proposed algorithms are not implementable due to excessive memory and time requirements. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on the design of resilient power distribution systems.},

The way to secure the distributed energy routing process that efficiently utilizes the distributed energy resources and minimizes the energy transmission overhead is essential in smart grid. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of the distributed energy routing process and investigate novel false data injection attacks against the energy routing process. We consider several general attacks, in which the adversary may manipulate the quantity of energy supply, the quantity of energy response, and the link state of energy transmission. The forged data injected by those attacks will cause imbalanced demand and supply, increase the cost for energy distribution, and disrupt the energy distribution. We formally model these attacks and quantitatively analyze their impact on energy distribution. Our evaluation data show that those attacks can effectively disrupt the effectiveness of energy distribution process, causing significant supplied energy loss, energy transmission cost and the number of outage users.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems typically consist of a combination of mobile devices, embedded systems and computers to monitor, sense, and actuate with the surrounding real world. These computing elements are usually wireless, interconnected to share data and interact with each other, with the server part and also with cloud computing services. In such a heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and considering the inherent variability of the context in these environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the proposed model has been built and an application example has been designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment.},

Today's end-to-end power and energy systems (from fuel source to end use) fundamentally depend on embedded and often an overlaid systems of sensors, computation, communication, control and optimization. There are even more opportunities and challenges in today's devices and systems, as well as in the emerging modern power systems – ranging from dollars, watts, emissions, standards, and more – at nearly every scale of sensing and control. Recent policies combined with potential for technological innovations and business opportunities, have attracted a high level of interest in smart grids. The potential for a highly distributed system with a high penetration of intermittent sources poses opportunities and challenges. Any complex dynamic infrastructure network typically has many layers, decision-making units and is vulnerable to various types of disturbances. Effective, intelligent, distributed control is required that would enable parts of the networks to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure. This presentation provides an overview of smart grids and recent advances in distributed sensing, modeling, and control, particularly at both the high-voltage power grid and at consumer level. Such advances may contribute toward the development of an effective, intelligent, distributed control of power system networks with a focus on addressing distributed sensing, computation, estimation, controls and dynamical systems challenges and opportunities ahead.},

abstract = {Reliable real-time sensing plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and safety of industrial cyberphysical systems (CPSs) such as wireless sensor and actuator networks. For many reasons, such as harsh industrial environments, fault-prone sensors, or malicious attacks, sensor readings may be abnormal or faulty. This could lead to serious system performance degradation or even catastrophic failure. Current anomaly detection approaches are either centralized and complicated or restricted due to strict assumptions, which are not suitable for practical large-scale networked industrial sensing systems (NISSs), where sensing devices are connected via digital communications, such as wireless sensor networks or smart grid systems. In this paper, we introduce a fully distributed general anomaly detection (GAD) scheme, which uses graph theory and exploits spatiotemporal correlations of physical processes to carry out real-time anomaly detection for general large-scale NISSs. We formally prove the scalability of our GAD approach and evaluate the performance of GAD for two industrial applications: building structure monitoring and smart grids. Extensive trace-driven simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Then, the measurement is transmitted to the remote controller via the communication channel, during which the signal may be delayed, lost or even sometimes not allowed for transmission due to the communication or energy constraints. In recent years, the modeling, analysis and synthesis of networked control systems (NCSs) have received great attention, which leads to a large number of publications. This paper attempts to present an overview of recent advances and unify them in a framework of network-induced issues such as signal sampling, data quantization, communication delay, packet dropouts, medium access constraints, channel fading and power constraint, and present respective solution approaches to each of these issues.

abstract = {Some uncertainties, such as the uncertain output power of a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) due to its stochastic charging and discharging schedule, that of a wind generation unit due to the stochastic wind speed, and that of a solar generating source due to the stochastic illumination intensity, volatile fuel prices, and future uncertain load growth could lead to some risks in determining the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generators (DGs) in distribution system planning. Given this background, under the chance constrained programming (CCP) framework, a new method is presented to handle these uncertainties in the optimal siting and sizing of DGs. First, a mathematical model of CCP is developed with the minimization of the DGs' investment cost, operating cost, maintenance cost, network loss cost, as well as the capacity adequacy cost as the objective, security limitations as constraints, and the siting and sizing of DGs as optimization variables. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation-embedded genetic-algorithm-based approach is employed to solve the developed CCP model. Finally, the IEEE 37-node test feeder is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed model and method, and the test results have demonstrated that the voltage profile and power-supply reliability for customers can be significantly improved and the network loss substantially reduced.},

These embedded systems have proliferated in almost all the modern electronic equipment used in industries, home, automobiles, military battlefields, space or personal consumer electronic systems. The omnipresent and pervasive computing enabled by these embedded systems controlling/monitoring a wide array of complex networked or independent systems, need to be dependable and safe. With mass proliferation, the security of embedded systems presents a unique set of requirements and challenges. It is therefore important to study and assess the potential risks, threat vectors, potential adversaries/attackers and attack methodologies in order to effectively incorporate security in technology and processes right from the conceptual/design stages. The identification and analysis of the threats, vulnerabilities and study of risk mitigation methods, potential attackers and common attack methodologies is critical in implementing security measures in design, development, exploitation and final disposal phases of the embedded system.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is the German vision for the future of manufacturing, where smart factories use information and communication technologies to digitise their processes to achieve improved quality, lower costs, and increased efficiency. It is likely to bring a massive change to the way control systems function today. Future distributed control systems are expected to have an increased connectivity to the Internet, in order to capitalize on new offers and research findings related to digitalization, such as cloud, big data, and machine learning. A key technology in the realization of distributed control systems is middleware, which is usually described as a reusable software layer between operating system and distributed applications. Various middleware technologies have been proposed to facilitate communication in industrial control systems and hide the heterogeneity amongst the subsystems, such as OPC UA, DDS, and RTCORBA. These technologies can significantly simplify the system design and integration of devices despite their heterogeneity. However, each of these technologies has its own characteristics that may work better for particular applications. Selection of the best middleware for a specific application is a critical issue for system designers. In this paper, we conduct a survey on available standard middleware technologies, including OPC UA, DDS, and RT-CORBA, and show new trends for different industrial domains. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. In the present paper, a networked control system under both cyber and physical attacks Is considered. An adapted formulation of the problem under physical attacks, data deception and false data injection attacks, is used for controller synthesis. Based on the classical fault tolerant detection (FTD) tools, a residual generator for attack/fault detection based on observers is proposed. An event-triggered and Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) implementation is proposed in order to achieve novel and better security strategy. The purpose in using this implementation would be to reduce (limit) the total number of transmissions to only instances when the networked control system (NCS) needs attention. It is important to note that the main contribution of this paper is to establish the adequate event-triggered and BMI-based methodology so that the particular structure of the mixed attacked/faulty structure can be re-formulated within the classical FTD paradigm. Experimental results are given to illustrate the developed approach efficiency on a pilot three-tank system. The plant model is presented and the proposed control design is applied to the system.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach for developing threat models for attacks on control systems. These models are useful for analyzing the actions taken by an attacker who gains access to control system assets and for evaluating the effects of the attacker's actions on the physical process being controlled. The paper proposes models for integrity attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and evaluates the physical and economic consequences of the attacks on a chemical reactor system. The analysis reveals two important points. First, a DoS attack does not have a significant effect when the reactor is in the steady state; however, combining the DoS attack with a relatively innocuous integrity attack rapidly causes the reactor to move to an unsafe state. Second, an attack that seeks to increase the operational cost of the chemical reactor involves a radically different strategy than an attack on plant safety (i.e., one that seeks to shut down the reactor or cause an explosion). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, as many distributed control systems become mobile, wireless, autonomous, ubiquitous and connected, the need for secure communication is imminent. In particular, the need for a general security framework with sufficiently flexible structure, and applicable for various use cases, emerges. Especially this applies to control system based on heterogeneous networks consisting of a wired and a wireless parts. Wired networks are nowadays often connected to Internet and thereby more exposed to potential attackers, and wireless networks are, by nature, more vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming and hijacking. In this paper we define a scope of use cases based on distributed control, together with requirements for evaluating existing security solutions and frameworks. In addition, several frameworks, mainly from the area of industrial automation, are surveyed and evaluated based on the identified use cases and security requirements.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new method for assessing the direct and indirect impacts of attacks on cyber–physical systems (CPSs). The proposed method studies the dynamic behavior of systems in normal situation and under security attacks and evaluates the consequence propagation of attacks. The inputs to the model are control parameters including sensor readings and controller signals. The output of the model is evaluating the consequence propagation of attacks, ranking the important assets of systems based on their sensitivity to conducted attacks, and prioritizing the attacks based on their impacts on the behavior of system. The validation phase of the proposed method is performed by modeling and evaluating the consequence propagation of attacks against a boiling water power plant (BWPP).},

abstract = {The massive proliferation of information and communications technologies (hardware and software) into the heart of modern critical infrastructures has given birth to a unique technological ecosystem. Despite the many advantages brought about by modern information and communications technologies, the shift from isolated environments to "systems-of-systems" integrated with massive information and communications infrastructures (e.g., the Internet) exposes critical infrastructures to significant cyber threats. Therefore, it is imperative to develop approaches for identifying and ranking assets in complex, large-scale and heterogeneous critical infrastructures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology for assessing the impacts of cyber attacks on critical infrastructures. The methodology is inspired by research in system dynamics and sensitivity analysis. The proposed behavioral analysis methodology computes the covariances of the observed variables before and after the execution of a specific intervention involving the control variables. Metrics are proposed for quantifying the significance of control variables and measuring the impact propagation of cyber attacks.Experiments conducted on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 300-bus electric grid models, and on the well-known Tennessee Eastman chemical process demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and cross-sector applicability of the proposed methodology in several attack scenarios. The advantages of the methodology over graph-theoretic and electrical centrality metric approaches are demonstrated using several test cases. Finally, a novel, stealthy cyber-physical attack is demonstrated against a simulated power grid; this attack can be used to analyze the precision of anomaly detection systems.},

Today's end-to-end power and energy systems (from fuel source to end use) fundamentally depend on embedded and often an overlaid systems of sensors, computation, communication, control and optimization. There are even more opportunities and challenges in today's devices and systems, as well as in the emerging modern power systems – ranging from dollars, watts, emissions, standards, and more – at nearly every scale of sensing and control. Recent policies combined with potential for technological innovations and business opportunities, have attracted a high level of interest in smart grids. The potential for a highly distributed system with a high penetration of intermittent sources poses opportunities and challenges. Any complex dynamic infrastructure network typically has many layers, decision-making units and is vulnerable to various types of disturbances. Effective, intelligent, distributed control is required that would enable parts of the networks to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure. This presentation provides an overview of smart grids and recent advances in distributed sensing, modeling, and control, particularly at both the high-voltage power grid and at consumer level. Such advances may contribute toward the development of an effective, intelligent, distributed control of power system networks with a focus on addressing distributed sensing, computation, estimation, controls and dynamical systems challenges and opportunities ahead.},

We briefly survey a number of research studies (specifically between 2008 and 2014) related to this issue and present their proposed solutions. Obviously, there is no complete solution, and our aim by conducting this review is to contribute (even a modest effort) on fighting against software tampering. Keywords:},

abstract = {This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Present distribution networks have not been designed to accept extensive Distributed Generation (DG). The present framework may change in the near future impelled by a worldwide increase in DG penetration in distribution grids. The mutual dependency of energy distribution and communications on the same grid requires new means for effectively monitoring and controlling both systems in parallel. Relaying and control IEDs can also serve as measurement units for power quality. Synchronized Measurement Technology (SMT) has the potential of becoming the backbone of this paradigm. By using wide-area information systems, the data can be made available to all involved partners. This paper provides different outlooks about the possibilities of Embedded Systems to integrate the protection, control and monitoring functions in Distribution Automation Systems. To justify the choice of synchronization technology, we have scheduled a complete sequence of synchronism tests and measurement tests based on standard specifications.},

abstract = {Partitioned software architectures were conceived to fulfill security and avionics requirements where predictability is extremely important. Both, the availability of new processors and an increased necessity of security, have opened new possibilities to use efficiently this approach. Avionic industry has consolidated the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) as a solution to manage the software growth in functionality and in efficiency. Now, the aerospace sector is adapting these concepts on its developments. One of the solutions used to achieve partitioned systems is based on virtualisation techniques. In this paper we present XtratuM, a bare-metal hypervisor which implements para-virtualization and dedicated device techniques. XtratuM provides a virtual machine that is 'near' the native one. It permits to execute a set of partitions, containing each one an operating systems and its applications. Security is based on the temporal and spatial isolation properties provided by the hypervisor. This paper describes the main design criteria used to achieve temporal and spatial partition isolation and an approach to extend the trusted environment from the hardware level to the hypervisor level in order to verify the temporal and spatial isolation properties},

abstract = {The recent advances in sensor and communication technologies can provide the foundations for linking the physical manufacturing facility and machine world to the cyber world of Internet applications. The coupled manufacturing cyber-physical system is envisioned to handle the actual operations in the physical world while simultaneously monitor them in the cyber world with the help of advanced data processing and simulation models at both the manufacturing process and system operational levels. Moreover, a sensor-packed manufacturing system in which each process or piece of equipment makes available event and status information, coupled with market research for true advanced Big Data analytics, seem to be the right ingredients for event response selection and operation virtualization. As a drawback, the resulting manufacturing cyber-physical system will be vulnerable to the inevitable cyber-attacks, unfortunately, so common for the software and Internet-based systems. This reality makes cybersecurity penetration within the manufacturing domain a need that goes uncontested across researchers and practitioners. This work provides a review of the current status of virtualization and cloud-based services for manufacturing systems and of the use of Big Data analytics for planning and control of manufacturing operations. Building on already developed cloud business solutions, cloud manufacturing is expected to offer improved enterprise manufacturing and business decision support. Based on the current state-of-the-art cloud manufacturing solutions and Big Data applications, this work also proposes a framework for the development of predictive manufacturing cyber-physical systems that include capabilities for attaching to the Internet of Things, and capabilities for complex event processing and Big Data algorithmic analytics.},

The process of optimization lies at the root of engineering, since the classical function of the engineer is to design new, better, more efficient and less expensive systems as well as to devise plans and procedures for the improved operation of existing systems. Most optimization routines are lengthy and therefore are efficiently applied through the use of the computer, but an understanding of the processes is needed to identify needs and interpret results.

abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

@article{Crocco2016,
abstract = {This paper shows for the first time that is possible to re- construct the position of rigid objects and to jointly recover affine camera calibration solely from a set of object detec- tions in a video sequence. In practice, this work can be con- sidered as the extension of Tomasi and Kanade factorization method using objects. Instead of using points to form a rank constrained measurement matrix, we can form a matrix with similar rank properties using 2D object detection proposals. In detail, we first fit an ellipse onto the image plane at each bounding box as given by the object detector. The collection of all the ellipses in the dual space is used to create a mea- surement matrix that gives a specific rank constraint. This matrix can be factorised and metrically upgraded in order to provide the affine camera matrices and the 3D position of the objects as an ellipsoid. Moreover, we recover the full 3D quadric thus giving additional information about object oc- cupancy and 3D pose. Finally, we also show that 2D points measurements can be seamlessly included in the framework to reduce the number of objects required. This last aspect unifies the classical point-based Tomasi and Kanade ap- proach with objects in a unique framework. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the feasibility of our ap- proach for the affine camera case. 1.},

As a result, the problem is broken into smaller instances, which are then separately solved and combined. Compared to the standard sequential approach, this framework has a lower computational complexity, it is independent from the initial pair of views, and copes better with drift problems.
