abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Power systems around the world are experiencing an evolution driven by the introduction of new energy resources. This evolution introduces new challenges one of these challenges is the risk of power system interruptions caused by relay misoperations. Technological advancement enables proposing new approaches to secure the protection system from such misoperations. This paper introduces new substation centralized protection scheme which monitors the protection system within the substation to detect hidden failures and increase protection system security. This monitoring is achieved by performing dynamic state estimation in real time. The process started by data streaming from the IEDs within the susbation to the CPS. Then, the CPS processes these data and performs the dynamic sate estimation. The CPS uses the Chi-square test to detect Abnormality. Upon detecting abnormality, hypothesis test is performed to classify the problem to either hidden failures or power faults. The detection of hidden failures initiate blocking signal to secure the affected IED from misoperations. The paper introduces the proposed architecture to provide a reliable data management and optimize the required communication system within the substation.},
