abstract = {This work addresses the general problem of resilient control of unknown stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems in the presence of sensor attacks. Motivated by a vehicle cruise control application, this work considers a first order system with multiple measurements, of which a bounded subset may be corrupted. A frequency-domain-designed resilient parameter-invariant controller is introduced that simultaneously minimizes the effect of corrupted sensors, while maintaining a desired closed-loop performance, invariant to unknown model parameters. Simulated results illustrate that the resilient parameter-invariant controller is capable of stabilizing unknown state disturbances and can perform state trajectory tracking. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the state of a noisy linear dynamical system when an unknown subset of sensors is arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary. We propose a secure state estimation algorithm, and derive (optimal) bounds on the achievable state estimation error given an upper bound on the number of attacked sensors. The proposed state estimator involves Kalman filters operating over subsets of sensors to search for a sensor subset which is reliable for state estimation. To further improve the subset search time, we propose Satisfiability Modulo Theory based techniques to exploit the combinatorial nature of searching over sensor subsets. Finally, as a result of independent interest, we give a coding theoretic view of attack detection and state estimation against sensor attacks in a noiseless dynamical system.},

@article{Wei2010,
abstract = {Like any other industry sector, the electrical power industry is facing challenges involved with the increasing demand for interconnected system operations and control under the restructured electrical industry due to deregulation of the electrical market and the trend of the Smart Grid . This moves automation networks from outdated, proprietary, closed networks to the more current arena of Information Technology (IT). However, while gaining all of the cost and performance benefits of IT, existing IT security challenges are acquired as well. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications in the network were not originally designed for the general IT environment. In this paper, we propose a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyber attacks. The following factors are taken into account: 1) integration with existing, legacy systems in a non-intrusive fashion; 2) desirable performance in terms of modularity, scalability, extendibility, and manageability; 3) alignment to the ¿Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy Sector¿ and the future intelligent power delivery systems. The on-site test result of the system prototype is briefly presented as well.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. We consider the problem of estimating the state of a linear time-invariant Gaussian system using m sensors, where a subset of the sensors can potentially be compromised by an adversary. We prove that under mild assumptions, we can decompose the optimal Kalman estimate as a weighted sum of local state estimates, each of which is derived using only the measurements from a single sensor. We then propose a convex optimization based approach, instead of the weighted sum approach, to combine the local estimate into a more secure state estimate. Our proposed estimator coincides with the Kalman estimator with certain probability when all sensors are benign and is stable when less than half of the sensors are compromised. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed state estimation scheme.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Power systems around the world are experiencing an evolution driven by the introduction of new energy resources. This evolution introduces new challenges one of these challenges is the risk of power system interruptions caused by relay misoperations. Technological advancement enables proposing new approaches to secure the protection system from such misoperations. This paper introduces new substation centralized protection scheme which monitors the protection system within the substation to detect hidden failures and increase protection system security. This monitoring is achieved by performing dynamic state estimation in real time. The process started by data streaming from the IEDs within the susbation to the CPS. Then, the CPS processes these data and performs the dynamic sate estimation. The CPS uses the Chi-square test to detect Abnormality. Upon detecting abnormality, hypothesis test is performed to classify the problem to either hidden failures or power faults. The detection of hidden failures initiate blocking signal to secure the affected IED from misoperations. The paper introduces the proposed architecture to provide a reliable data management and optimize the required communication system within the substation.},

abstract = {This book reports the development of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) methods with their application to real plants. After an introduction to fault diagnosis and FTC, a chapter on actuators and sensors in systems with varying degrees of nonlinearity leads to three chapters in which the design of FTC systems is given thorough coverage for real applications: a winding machine typifying a subsystem in various sheet and film processes; a hydraulic 3-tank system representative of those used widely in chemical plants; and an active suspension system demonstrating application in whole large-scale systems by splitting into subsystems. Actuator and sensor faults are accommodated within the control-law design and the integration of fault diagnosis models in the FTC systems described. Linearized systems around an operating point and nonlinear systems are discussed and illustrated. A complete simulation platform of the 3-tank system is provided via download from www.springer.com},

@article{Rana2017,
abstract = {The penetration of renewable distributed energy resources such as wind turbine has been dramatically integrated in distribution networks due to clean, sustainable, and economical green energy. Due to intermittent wind speed, the power generation patterns vary which can risk the distribution network operation. So, it is intrinsically required to monitor the wind turbines in a distributed way. This paper presents an adaptive-then-combine distributed dynamic approach for monitoring the grid under lossy communication link between the wind turbines and energy management system. Firstly, the wind turbine is represented by a state-space linear equation, with sensors deployed to obtain system state information. Based on the mean squared error principle, an adaptive approach is proposed to estimate the local state information. The global estimation is designed by combining estimation results with weighting factors which are calculated by minimizing estimation error covariance based on semi-definite programming. Finally, the convergence analysis indicates that estimation error is gradually decreased, so the estimated state converges to the actual state. The efficacy of the developed approach is verified using the turbine model. The research is valuable for green energy technologies, households and interconnected industrial information societies, and also provides the knowledge towards a smart and secure green energy future.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on securely estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamical system from a set of corrupted measurements. In particular, we consider two broad classes of nonlinear systems, and propose a technique which enables us to perform secure state estimation for such nonlinear systems. We then provide guarantees on the achievable state estimation error against arbitrary corruptions, and analytically characterize the number of errors that can be perfectly corrected by a decoder. To illustrate how the proposed nonlinear estimation approach can be applied to practical systems, we focus on secure estimation for the wide area control of an interconnected power system under cyber-physical attacks and communication failures, and propose a secure estimator for the power system. Finally, we numerically show that the proposed secure estimation algorithm enables us to reconstruct the attack signals accurately.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {With the popularity of Supervisory Information System (SIS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, we can easily obtain abundant sensor data in manufacturing. We could save manufacturing maintenance costs and prevent further damages if we can accurately predict system anomalies from the sensor data. Yet learning from individual sensors often cannot directly determine whether the system will have anomaly because each sensor only measures a partial state of a big system. By detecting events across sensors collectively and their temporal dependencies, this paper proposes a new system-level anomaly prediction framework by mining anomaly dependency graph from sensor data. The advantages of the approach include explainability, collective prediction and temporal sensitivity. We applied our approach with a real-world power plant dataset to evaluate its feasibility.},
